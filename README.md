# giphyapi
I built this app to learn about working with APIs. You can search for a gif based on your input or click for a random gif.

Notes: 
* You will need to get your own Giphy API key to make this app work. Sign up for a free account at developers.giphy.com.
* This app is not designed to hide your API key on the back end with an environmental variable. You are at possible risk of exposing your API key on the front end if you play with this code and share it publicly. Since Giphy's API is free, the worst thing that will happen is that you will be rate limited, but it's good practice to always protect your API keys by placing them on the back end.
* You're probably asking why I didn't add setup for the back end on this app. It's because my main goal was to learn fetch and async functions to retrieve data from APIs. I wasn't ready for anything else at the time.
